Awesome, positive, funny staff. I love jersey mikes, best sandwiches with fresh meat. Quick service, and clean restaurant.

This is a lot better than jimmy Johns, but this silly idea that they have to slice everything while you wait is ridiculous and slow.  I get that it makes it feel fresh, but you are serving compressed ham!  Slice a bunch and get the line moving.  The mini size is large enough for most adults.  It's a great lunch option twice a month.  Go during off times because the bottleneck at the slicer can cause you to wait.

I used to live right by this place, and I stopped in a few times after they opened. It's a pretty standard sub place. I wasn't super impressed (the jersey mike dressing made my bread really soggy) but my boyfriend enjoyed his sub.
!!
4
I went there for the first time as they sent me a free sub for my birthday. It was really good, and reasonably priced. I will return.
!!

Fresh bread. Nice amount of meat. CRISPY BACON! I'll be back! Lettuce was a bit brown though. Other than that, nice sub shop!
!!
5
Outstanding location!! The wait wasn't bad since I called the order in ahead of time! The  food was fresh and plenty of it! Good service! Just wish they had hair nets or restraints on! Very clean Restaurant!

Probably the only pastrami sandwich I haven't liked.

I like Jersey Mike's, but I'm never coming to this location again. The guy at the counter is extremely rude.  He seemed more interested in his friends that were hanging out in the lobby rather than taking my simple order.

Once again perfection and awesome club Supremes with bacon! TRY THEM! Outstanding customer service! Restaurant was clean!

Workers consistently changing gloves, this is what I pay attention to most.  Every time they handled a new topping or patty, they switched gloves.  Satisfied with their attentiveness, keep it up, that doesn't happen everywhere and people notice!
!!
5
Five Guys consistently delivers a good hamburger and fries. I like the amount of customizing I can do to my burger. The choices of trimmings is impressive.
!!
3
Five Guys would get four stars if they offered gluten free buns and decreased the spice level of their Cajun fries. If I'm in the area, I'd stop again.
!!
3
Good burger, juicy and not dried out.  Better than decent fries.
!!
5
Great!! Workers are always friendly! The manager was at the register with a new employee and we were all just making small talk.
!!
2
Good food but wow horrible staff - just rude and unpleasant, short with the customers. My family couldn't believe the rude service when ordering.
!!
4
Fresh ingredients and great fries. As people say, they taste more like potatoes and less as fried food.
!!
3
Its ok but over priced for a burger. I didn't really think it was the greatest. It was good though and much better than McDonalds. I think the fries are the best.
!!
5
Great burger! The Small burger would have been sufficient though, only one patty. The French fries were excellent and fresh!
!!
5
Wow that was good. Disclosure, I'm not really a burger guy. But I thought the hamburger here was delicious. I really liked it.
!!
4
Huge fan of 5 guys. They are consistently the best $8 burger you can buy. They are freshly made and the fries are even good. The meal is extremely filling and for $10. I can't think of a better meal.

I like this place but they let homeless people hang out in there asking for food like damn dude can I enjoy my meal without the guilt trip jeeze that's all I have to say.
!!

I love that Panera has the rapid pick-up option now and use it about once a week for a quick dinner.

The staff here was really on their game. Sandwiches came out well 'dressed' with ingredients, hot and tasty!

I have been to a few Panera locations, and I would have to say that this one is, by far, one of the nicest ones. It is clean, spacious, and the staff is friendly.

I usually come here to grab some breakfast on my way to work....I come here enough that the staff know my name and what I order (because I usually order the same thing but sometimes I'll change it up).

Clean, good food at very reasonable prices. Their salads are excellent and you can customize them. Service is quite fast and you can order through an app and just pickup.
!!
2
The service was below average and the prices were worse in comparison to Panera or Brueggers. All around was disappointed with the experience. Find myself waiting idly for the food right now wishing I had the warm embrace of a Brueggers western everything bagel, but alas; it was not meant to be.

Clean, quick, efficient. Everything you'd want in a Chipotle. They cater well the young college crowd they have and do so in a timely fashion.
!!

I've grown up eating chipotle and this business has only disappointed from the start. They constantly give you the minimal amount of serving sizes possible.

Consistently mediocre service. Decent food. Employee was too busy coloring on two guacamole cups that were taped together to hold a conversation and explain the status of my order.

I've been here at least 45 times and every time has been fast, efficient, and delicious.

Great spot for a quick lunch. Service is always super quick and all the employees are super nice.
!!

I've pretty much accepted the fact that I am the only person who ever orders tacos here. I'm sure at their corporate HQ every week when the discussion comes up about removing tacos from their menu, they always point to that one guy in Milwaukee who orders them every week. Thank you, all wise and attractive Chipotle board members.

This is the 2nd time I pay about $5 for 6 tiny PCs of nuggets all overcooked and too salty and almost burned. I want to talk to manager about it. He was busy. Was told to come back later!!!! That was my last purchase from them.
!!

I was surprised to read so many negative reviews (some of which were quite silly). I have eaten at CFA since 1975! I've eaten at locations all throughout South Carolina and North Carolina. My favorite sandwich is the grilled (or fried--yum!), and I love the chicken STRIPS. Their chicken biscuits are great for breakfast. Their wait staff is the friendliest of ANY fast food restaurant I have ever frequented. Thumbs up to CFA!!!
!!

We had a wonderful experience at out local store as always. Excellent food and friendly service. They always make you feel like the customer is number one which is sorely lacking in most businesses.

STAY AWAY FROM THIS STORE!!

I am writing this to let you know about the managers that you hire to run Chick-Fil-A. Bob ** managers Brandon ** and Melissa ** are a joke of management. They are horrible on how they treat their customers and their employees. I am keeping my identity anonymous so I get no retaliation, for reporting the truth.
!!
4
I frequent your establishment, probably once a week. Everything I've ever ordered has been really good and consistent. Your drive thru service is especially better than any others.
!!

We've eaten at numerous fast food restaurants with our children over the years. Chick-fil-a is an obvious step above the rest.

Lady had attitude. Didn’t listen. Couldn’t even cut sandwiches in half right. Couldn’t hear her. Being rude. Rolling eyes. I don’t want her to take my order but she just had a really ugly attitude. Needs to work on customer service.
!!
1
The ad with the leaf blower blowing open the kids mouth really isn't appetizing and makes me not want to eat there. Anyway the food has gone south in the last five years. Something about the bread. It's awful.
!!
2
I'm going to get straight to the point. Subway sandwiches are expensive and full of nothing. It does not matter what bread you pick or what sandwich they make. Every sandwich looks like it's been rolled over by a mac truck and tastes dead like cardboard with some onions and vinegar added.
!!
1
Two words... "Jared Fogle". His own ex-wife admitted that Subway had knowledge of Jared’s pedophile tendencies but still continued use him as the spokesperson for their franchise??? That’s reason enough to never give ANY Subway franchise a penny of my money.
!!

Subway is very well advertised, they advertised their new turkey bacon sub on the television and then I just continued to see it everywhere. When I finally went to go get some I walked in and it smelled of fresh bread, the worker was very kind and helpful.
!!

Went to Subway last night. One poor girl working her you know what off for I bet crappy pay... It seems to have smaller meatballs every time I go there.
!!
2
My husband and I eat at Subway a lot. On the healthy menu you went up in price and cut quantity of meat and cheese. Very noticeable. Not Happy. We don't mind paying for what we get but, we feel ripped off. There's many sub shops in our area and we will be trying them.
!!
5
We are steady customers of Subway, our favorite by far is the Subway at #23406-0, 140 Airport Road, Arden, NC. It is always clean, the work area is always clean and well organized. The servers are the best. They always make you feel welcome, they are quick, they are a great team. There are SUBS always great.

Great deal with the all you can eat sushi (and more). It's pretty good sushi, too.
!!

The fish was really fresh, and the sushi was well prepared. The service was awful. Overall mixed feelings about the experience.
!!
5
I'm a hearty eater (read:  gluttonous slob), so the AYCE sushi is a really good deal for me. I've been there several times and always thoroughly enjoy my experience. I think the service is just fine and the quality of the food is great. Favorites are the kiss-on- fire, spicy girl maki & rainbow rolls.
!!
3
This restaurant deserves a higher rating for the food. The food is definitely delicious and worth the all you can eat price. The service is another story.
!!
4
Impressed with all you can eat sushi for $15.95.  Lunch time is very  busy unless you go towards the end of the lunch period (11-3).  Disappointing that I couldn't get the green tea ice cream had to settle for chocolate ice cream.
!!
5
Tons of sushi options. Fresh & delicious too! They're all you can eat sushi option is really great, $25 for literally as much sushi as you want. Amazing right? Definitely would come here again!

The food was decent, but not enough to compensate for the misleading and unprofessional service.
!!

Not much personality to the service (at all) but the food was terrific, unlimited in the all you can eat, and widely varied.
